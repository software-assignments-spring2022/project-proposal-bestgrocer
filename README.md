# RepostBuster

## What is this?

Image hosting sites including Twitter and Instagram have become great platforms for artists to share their work with thousands of people on the internet. These artists can range from simple hobbiests to seasoned industry professionals, but there is one thing that all online artists come in contact with: **Art Theft**.

Artists have the right to determine how they would like their images to be use. Despite this there is a misconception that just because an image is free on the internet, it is free to use however you wish. Because of this there are countless instances of people unrightfully reuploading images, using them for commercial use, or even flat out pladgiarism. This is commonly refered to as Art Theft.

Often times the only way to combat this is to manually find the stolen work and report it yourself. However, this process can be extreemly tedious and time consuming. In addition, there are very few tools out there that help to combat this issue. That is where RepostBuster comes in.

**RepostBuster will be an easy to use web application that finds instances of reposted images on the internet.**

The goal of RepostBuster will be to help enforce the digital license and copyright of digital artists and their artwork. 


## Okay. But how will this work?

The user will be able to upload an image to the program. RepostBuster will then use this image to perform a **reverse image search** to find any duplicate instances of the image on the internet. The user will also provide their own credetials so that the program will only find instances of the image being used by other people.

RepostBuster will provide the user of a list of links to any reuploaded instances that it finds. 

### Techstack 

This will be possible through the use of the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision), which will make the image search functionality possible.

The rest will be made possible using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## Thats cool, but how will you get this done?

The only major roadblock will be implementing the reverse image search functionality in a usable way. The rest will involve integrating it into a webapplication in a functional way.

I estimate a team of 4-5 people will allow us to propperly complete this project for this class.
